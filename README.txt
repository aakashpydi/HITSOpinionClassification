In this project, I replicated the key results from the paper, "A Novel Two-stage Framework for 
Extracting Opinionated Sentences from News Articles" (Pujari, Rajkumar. Desai, Swara. Ganguly, Niloy. Goyal, Pawan)

The project entails using a combination of the Naive Bayes classifier and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic
Search algorithm to carry out fact/opinion classification of sentences in a given corpus.
